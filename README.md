Our group collaborated on developing a comprehensive school management application using JavaFX for the frontend and integrated backend functionalities, leveraging Java's Database Connectivity (JDBC) for data storage and retrieval. With a team of four, we designed a user-friendly interface allowing administrators, teachers, and students to manage various aspects of school operations. The backend system efficiently handled tasks such as student enrollment, course scheduling, and grade management. This group project not only showcased our proficiency in Java programming and database management but also demonstrated our ability to collaborate effectively in developing complex software solutions.
